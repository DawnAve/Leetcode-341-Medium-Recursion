# Leetcode-341-Medium-Recursion
Simple recursion should be easy, but this question is combined with class. To someone who is not familiar to class like me, it feels like a hard question. 

DO NOT try to directly run the code, since it includes helper functions provided by Leetcode. To be honest, it is just a simple recursion, but things that I learn the most
is about how to use them in a class. As my professor said, PROCESS NOT PRODUCT. 

It will be a good practice for someone who have relatively less experience with Phthon classes.
